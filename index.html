    <h2> My Story </h2>
    <p> I am a professional software developer and tech enthusiast.
      I like to solve problems using technology,
      learn new tools and stay on the edge.
      Currently, I work full time and pursuing my software engineering degree at HES.
       I love to travel, try different cuisines and learn to speak different languages.
       Iâ€™ve traveled to the most parts of the continental US, Asia and Europe.
        I can speak in six different languages.</p>
